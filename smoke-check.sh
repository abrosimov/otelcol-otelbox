# Post-build smoke check for the OCB-built otelcol-otelbox binary.
#
# Verifies that every component declared in builder.yaml actually made it into
# the binary, by comparing per-kind counts from the manifest against the
# binary's own `components` output. Counts rather than names, deliberately:
# a component's reported name is its type, not its Go module path, and the two
# do not map mechanically (resourcedetectionprocessor → resource_detection,
# otlpexporter → otlp_grpc, otlpreceiver → otlp). Counts are derivable from both
# sides without a hand-maintained translation table that would rot on every bump.
#
# On top of the counts, two components are asserted by name because they carry
# the invariants the collector exists for: file_storage (durability — the WAL
# that survives outages) and redaction (privacy — credential stripping before
# export).
#
# Usage: ./smoke-check.sh <binary> [builder.yaml]
# Exits non-zero with a per-kind diff on any mismatch.
